    <h1>Tire Chain Finder</h1> 
   <p>This was a fun project where we wanted to setup an aesthetically attractive and easy-to-use tire chain finder. Unfortunately, the tire chains ended
  up being too pricey to make sense to sell at the company I work for, but we didn't know this before I built out the project. </p>  
    <p>I converted an excel file to JSON then used XML and jQuery UI autocomplete to create the search. In addition to functionality, I did the 
  page layout (not the photographs though). </p>

      <div class="project-items"><img style="max-width: 50%" src="https://hollyhascode.github.io/mothercodesbest/images/tirechainfinder.png"></div> 
      <div class="project-items">Here is a screenshot of the general layout. The client prefers longer landing pages, but I wanted the main focus to be just entering a tire size.<br>
           The contact form at the bottom has a parralex background of a snow scene - this came out silly looking in the screenshot. <br> 
The aesthetics of this project were fun! Who doesn't like snow - or at least pictures of it! My favorite part though was learning more about ajax, json, jquery and react throughout the process.<br> 
From a business point of view, I learned the pain of creating something beautiful and functional that will probably never be used - the company decided in the end to not sell tire chains.<br> 
From a designer's point of view, I learned to not be so forward with animations. The categories have 3d flip cards that transform with CSS - this is buggy in internet explorer. I also find it personally to be to flashy. 
The owner and vice-president of the company LOVE it though, so now they want it on all of the front pages of their websites.<br> 
To remedy this problem, I plan to do some UX experiments after launch to test the usability of the flip boxes. Given our demographic is mainly older blue collar males looking for 
        a simple product, my hypothesis is that it won't do so well.
