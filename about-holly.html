<h1>About Mother Codes Best Goofball Extraordinaire</h1> 

<p>I am front end web developer wtih a background in digital marketing. Currently, I'm studying UX at Lesley University
where i'm growing my soft skills and privately I spend time working on my technical skills.</p> 
<p>My hopes for this blog aren't to become a hot shot entrepreneur selling t-shirts, courses or whatever. I just want a place to document 
my experience as a coder, mom and student. You know sort of a portfolio with a title to scare of any employers who don't want to hire a mum!</p> 
<p>I'm so thankful for the amount of resources provided by all the dedicated bloggers, teachers and companies out there, I won't even pretend 
to compete. I just love the subjective and objective challenges of web developement for companies and want to share some things I learn (often the hard way) along the way.
(Plus, us New Orleaneans are too busy doing things like Mardi Gras, Jazz Fest, etc.</p>
<p>Cheers! Here is to another year of foibles, bugs and development.</p>
